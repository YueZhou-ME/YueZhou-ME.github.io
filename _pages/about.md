I am currently advancing my academic journey at the School of Energy and Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China. My research is under the dedicated supervision of **Prof. [Minghou Xu](http://xu.energy.hust.edu.cn/index.htm)**. Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor of Energy and Environmental Systems Engineering degree from Nanjing Normal University, in 2021, under the nurturing guidance of **Prof. [Jian Sun]( https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sKkDngIAAAAJ&hl=en)**.

My research is primarily centered around the material design and performance improvement of perovskite for **thermochemical heat storage**, deciphering the thermodynamic and chemical mechanisms underneath the explicit heat storage capacity change of materials. Moreover, I have also done research on inhibiting the decline of the heat storage.

**If you are interested in my projects or just having a nice chat**, please feel free to email me (yuezhou2023@gmail.com)!  I am always happy to discuss with / learn from brilliant minds ^_^!
